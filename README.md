## Overview
  W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
  Create two seperate queries to find the temperture for the month June and December. Convert these two queries into Pandas DataFrames and then into a summary statistics to be compared. That way, W. Avy can gain better judgement for the ice cream shop.
  
## Results
### Results for Both June and December

* The result for each month are very similar. The average tempture in December is 71 and for June is 75.

* The most notable difference is the minimum tempture for December is 56 and for June is 64. Leaving a difference of 8 degrees. 

* However the standard deviation for both months, December at 3.74 and June at 3.25. Meaning, while it's possible to get this cold it's more likely to be a cool 70 degrees. Perfect ice cream weather!

## Summary
Overall, the location of the shop is a fantastic spot. The weather is very temperment with minimal change throughout the year. The fear of losing sales during the  cold months is very minimal compared to other cities in the USA. It will likely take longer to warm during the winter months. My suggestion would be to open later in the day to take advantage of prime ice cream selling time and reduce labor cost.
Percipation would be more of a concern for the area. If the space has the ability host both indoor and outdoor seating would be ideal.
If it rains a little the we can put an umbrella on their ice cream!
