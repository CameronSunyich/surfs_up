## Overview
  W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
  Create two separate queries to find the temperature for the month of June and December. Convert these two queries into Pandas DataFrames and then into a summary statistics to be compared. That way, W. Avy can gain better judgment for the ice cream shop.

* The result for each month is very similar. The average temperature in December is 71 and for June is 75 degrees.

* The most notable difference is the minimum temperature for December is 56 and for June is 64 degrees. Leaving a difference of 8 degrees. 

* However, the standard deviation for both months has only a slight change. December at 3.74 and June at 3.25 degrees. Meaning, while it's possible to get this cold as 54 degrees. It's more likely to be a cool 70 degrees. Still, warm enough for ice cream!

## Summary
Overall, the location of the shop is a fantastic spot. The weather is very temperament with minimal change throughout the year. The fear of losing sales during the cold months is very minimal compared to other cities in the U.S.A. It will more likely take longer for the day to warm during the winter months. My suggestion would be to open later in the day to take advantage of prime ice cream selling time and reduce labor costs. 
Precipitation would be a larger concern for the area. It would be ideal if the space could host both indoor and outdoor seating. And, if it rains add a little umbrella to their ice cream!
